	abstract = {Spins associated with single defects in solids provide promising qubits for quantum-information processing and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated long coherence times, high-fidelity operations, and long-range entanglement. However, control has so far been limited to a few qubits, with entangled states of three spins demonstrated. Realizing larger multiqubit registers is challenging due to the need for quantum gates that avoid cross talk and protect the coherence of the complete register. In this paper, we present novel decoherence-protected gates that combine dynamical decoupling of an electron spin with selective phase-controlled driving of nuclear spins. We use these gates to realize a ten-qubit quantum register consisting of the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center and nine nuclear spins in diamond. We show that the register is fully connected by generating entanglement between all 45 possible qubit pairs and realize genuine multipartite entangled states with up to seven qubits. Finally, we investigate the register as a multiqubit memory. We demonstrate the protection of an arbitrary single-qubit state for over 75 s—the longest reported for a single solid-state qubit—and show that two-qubit entanglement can be preserved for over 10 s. Our results enable the control of large quantum registers with long coherence times and therefore open the door to advanced quantum algorithms and quantum networks with solid-state spin qubits.},

We used optical methods and dynamical decoupling to realize this potential for an ensemble of phosphorous-31 donors in isotopically purified silicon-28 and observed a room-temperature coherence time of over 39 minutes.

This allows for many quantum error correction protocols, which will be essential for scale-up. However, a proven method of reliably coupling spatially separated donor qubits has yet to be identified. We present a scalable silicon-based platform using the unique optical properties of “deep” chalcogen donors. For the prototypical 77Se+ donor, we measure lower bounds on the transition dipole moment and excited-state lifetime, enabling access to the strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics using known silicon photonic resonator technology and integrated silicon photonics. We also report relatively strong photon emission from this same transition. These results unlock clear pathways for silicon-based quantum computing, spin-to-photon conversion, photonic memories, integrated single-photon sources, and all-optical switches.},

The strong coupling regime, when interaction between sensor and sample spins dominates all other interactions, is one such strategy. In this regime, classically forbidden detection of completely unpolarized nuclei is allowed, going beyond statistical fluctuations in magnetization. Here we realize strong coupling between an atomic (nitrogen–vacancy) sensor and sample nuclei to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on four 29Si spins. We exploit the field gradient created by the diamond atomic sensor, in concert with compressed sensing, to realize imaging protocols, enabling individual nuclei to be located with Angstrom precision.

	abstract = {Single photon detection is a key resource for sensing at the quantum limit and the enabling technology for measurement-based quantum computing. Photon detection at optical frequencies relies on irreversible photoassisted ionization of various natural materials. However, microwave photons have energies 5 orders of magnitude lower than optical photons, and are therefore ineffective at triggering measurable phenomena at macroscopic scales. Here, we report the observation of a new type of interaction between a single two-level system (qubit) and a microwave resonator. These two quantum systems do not interact coherently; instead, they share a common dissipative mechanism to a cold bath: the qubit irreversibly switches to its excited state if and only if a photon enters the resonator. We have used this highly correlated dissipation mechanism to detect itinerant photons impinging on the resonator. This scheme does not require any prior knowledge of the photon waveform nor its arrival time, and dominant decoherence mechanisms do not trigger spurious detection events (dark counts). We demonstrate a detection efficiency of 58\% and a record low dark count rate of 1.4 per millisecond. This work establishes engineered nonlinear dissipation as a key enabling resource for a new class of low-noise nonlinear microwave detectors.},

	abstract = {Quantum emitters respond to resonant illumination by radiating part of the absorbed energy. A component of this radiation field is phase coherent with the driving tone, whereas another component is incoherent and consists of spontaneously emitted photons, forming the fluorescence signal1. Atoms, molecules and colour centres are routinely detected by their fluorescence at optical frequencies, with important applications in quantum technology2,3 and microscopy4–7. By contrast, electron spins are usually detected by the phase-coherent echoes that they emit in response to microwave driving pulses8. The incoherent part of their radiation—a stream of microwave photons spontaneously emitted upon individual spin relaxation events—has not been observed so far because of the low spin radiative decay rate and of the lack of single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs). Here using superconducting quantum devices, we demonstrate the detection of a small ensemble of donor spins in silicon by their fluorescence at microwave frequencies and millikelvin temperatures. We enhance their radiative decay rate by coupling them to a high-quality-factor and small-mode-volume superconducting resonator9, and we connect the device output to a newly developed SMPD10 based on a superconducting qubit. In addition, we show that the SMPD can be used to detect spin echoes and that standard spin characterization measurements (Rabi nutation and spectroscopy) can be achieved with both echo and fluorescence detection. We discuss the potential of SMPD detection as a method for magnetic resonance spectroscopy of small numbers of spins.},

The realization of these goals requires the development of spin detection techniques that are many orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional NMR and MRI, capable of detecting and controlling nanoscale ensembles of spins.

As an initial step towards this goal, isolated nuclear spins and spin pairs have been mapped14–21. However, large clusters of interacting spins—such as those found in molecules—result in highly complex spectra. Imaging these complex systems is challenging because it requires high spectral resolution and efficient spatial reconstruction with sub-ångström precision. Here we realize such atomic-scale imaging using a single nitrogen vacancy centre as a quantum sensor, and demonstrate it on a model system of 27 coupled 13C nuclear spins in diamond. We present a multidimensional spectroscopy method that isolates individual nuclear–nuclear spin interactions with high spectral resolution (less than 80 millihertz) and high accuracy (2 millihertz). We show that these interactions encode the composition and inter-connectivity of the cluster, and develop methods to extract the three-dimensional structure of the cluster with sub-ångström resolution.

	abstract = {Nuclear spins are highly coherent quantum objects. In large ensembles, their control and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, for example, in chemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear spins also featured in early proposals for solid-state quantum computers1 and demonstrations of quantum search2 and factoring3 algorithms. Scaling up such concepts requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when coupled to an electron4–6. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating magnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices, because the field cannot be localized or screened. Control via electric fields would resolve this problem, but previous methods7–9 relied on transducing electric signals into magnetic fields via the electron–nuclear hyperfine interaction, which severely affects nuclear coherence. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum control of a single 123Sb (spin-7/2) nucleus using localized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic device. The method exploits an idea proposed in 196110 but not previously realized experimentally with a single nucleus. Our results are quantitatively supported by a microscopic theoretical model that reveals how the purely electrical modulation of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction results in coherent nuclear spin transitions that are uniquely addressable owing to lattice strain. The spin dephasing time, 0.1 seconds, is orders of magnitude longer than those obtained by methods that require a coupled electron spin to achieve electrical driving. These results show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could be deployed as chaotic models, strain sensors and hybrid spin-mechanical quantum systems using all-electrical controls. Integrating electrically controllable nuclei with quantum dots11,12 could pave the way to scalable, nuclear- and electron-spin-based quantum computers in silicon that operate without the need for oscillating magnetic fields.},

Here, we map a network of 50 coupled spins through high-resolution correlated sensing schemes, using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We develop concatenated double-resonance sequences that identify spin-chains through the network. These chains reveal the characteristic spin frequencies and their interconnections with high spectral resolution, and can be fused together to map out the network. Our results provide new opportunities for quantum simulations by increasing the number of available spin qubits.

Nuclear spins in the solid state have shown great promise as long-lived qubits. Control and readout of individual nuclear spin qubit registers has made major progress in the recent years using individual electron spin ancilla addressed either electrically or optically. Here, we present a new platform for quantum information processing, consisting of \${\textasciicircum}\{183\}\$W nuclear spin qubits adjacent to an Er\${\textasciicircum}\{3+\}\$ impurity in a CaWO\$\_4\$ crystal, interfaced via a superconducting resonator and detected using a microwave photon counter at 10mK. We study two nuclear spin qubits with \$T\_2{\textasciicircum}*\$ of \$0.8(2){\textasciitilde}\$s and \$1.2(3){\textasciitilde}\$s, \$T\_2\$ of \$3.4(4){\textasciitilde}\$s and \$4.4(6){\textasciitilde}\$ s, respectively. We demonstrate single-shot quantum non-demolition readout of each nuclear spin qubit using the Er\${\textasciicircum}\{3+\}\$ spin as an ancilla. We introduce a new scheme for all-microwave single- and two-qubit gates, based on stimulated Raman driving of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We realize single- and two-qubit gates on a timescale of a few milliseconds, and prepare a decoherence-protected Bell state with 88\% fidelity and \$T\_2{\textasciicircum}*\$ of \$1.7(2){\textasciitilde}\$s. Our results are a proof-of-principle demonstrating the potential of solid-state nuclear spin qubits as a promising platform for quantum information processing.

These methods are system-specific or sensitive only in a small detection volume13,14, so that practical single-spin detection remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate single-electron magnetic resonance by spin fluorescence detection15, using a microwave photon counter at millikelvin temperatures16. We detect individual paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal coupled to a high-quality-factor planar superconducting resonator to enhance their radiative decay rate17, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in one second integration time. The fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the spin radiative lifetime. The method has the potential to be applied to arbitrary paramagnetic species with long enough non-radiative relaxation times, and allows single-spin detection in a volume as large as the resonator magnetic mode volume (approximately 10 μm3 in the present experiment), orders of magnitude larger than other single-spin detection techniques. As such, it may find applications in magnetic resonance and quantum computing.},

Measurements can be performed via localized electrons, such as those in single atom dopants8,9 or crystal defects10–12. However, establishing long-range interactions between multiple dopants or defects is challenging13,14. Conversely, in lithographically defined quantum dots, tunable interdot electron tunnelling allows direct coupling of electron spin-based qubits in neighbouring dots15–20. Moreover, the compatibility with semiconductor fabrication techniques21 may allow for scaling to large numbers of qubits in the future. Unfortunately, hyperfine interactions are typically too weak to address single nuclei. Here we show that for electrons in silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor quantum dots the hyperfine interaction is sufficient to initialize, read out and control single 29Si nuclear spins. This approach combines the long coherence times of nuclear spins with the flexibility and scalability of quantum dot systems. We demonstrate high-fidelity projective readout and control of the nuclear spin qubit, as well as entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins. Crucially, we find that both the nuclear spin and electron spin retain their coherence while moving the electron between quantum dots. Hence we envision long-range nuclear–nuclear entanglement via electron shuttling3. Our results establish nuclear spins in quantum dots as a powerful new resource for quantum processing.},

	abstract = {Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which obscures molecule-to-molecule variations. Solid-state spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 (14N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements reveal correlations between the Hamiltonian parameters associated with the NV center’s electronic and nuclear spin states, as well as a previously unreported symmetry-breaking quadrupolar term. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, read out, and control the quantum evolution of the 14N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing1,2, because of their exceptional quantum coherence3 and atomic-scale footprint. However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, owing to the lack of methods with which to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted 31P donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin4, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)\%. The quantum operations are precisely characterized using gate set tomography (GST)5, yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2)\%, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11)\% and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4)\%. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors6. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)\% fidelity. Because electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons7–9 or physically shuttled across different locations10,11, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins.},

The principle motivation is to provide a means of obtaining solid state spectra of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions of disordered systems without the line broadening associated with random orientation with respect to the applied magnetic field. Comparison is made to previous frequency domain and high field methods. A general density operator formalism is given for the experiments where the evolution period is initiated by a sudden switching to zero field and is terminated by a sudden restoration of the field. Analytical expressions for the signals are given for a variety of simple dipolar and quadrupolar systems and numerical simulations are reported for up to six coupled spin‐1/2 nuclei. Experimental results are reported or reviewed for 1H, 2D, 7Li, 13C, and 27Al nuclei in a variety of polycrystalline materials. The effects of molecular motion and bodily sample rotation are described. Various extensions of the method are discussed, including demagnetized initial conditions and correlation by two‐dimensional Fourier transformation of zero field spectra with themselves or with high field spectra.},

This 1.5 T field was chosen as a compromise between the signal-to-noise ratio of the spin-echo signal, which increases at higher frequencies, and the line broadening due to the presence of magnetic impurities of these materials, which leads to a decrease of the resolution at higher magnetic fields. The preliminary experiments show that this setup can be used to the study the interaction of different types of ions with cementitious materials.

	abstract = {Two- and three-dimensional lead-halide perovskite (LHP) materials are novel semiconductors that have generated broad interest owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Characterization and understanding of their atomic structure and structure–property relationships are often nontrivial as a result of the vast structural and compositional tunability of LHPs as well as the enhanced structure dynamics as compared with oxide perovskites or more conventional semiconductors. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy contributes to this thrust through its unique capability of sampling chemical bonding element-specifically (1/2H, 13C, 14/15N, 35/37Cl, 39K, 79/81Br, 87Rb, 127I, 133Cs, and 207Pb nuclei) and locally and shedding light onto the connectivity, geometry, topology, and dynamics of bonding. NMR can therefore readily observe phase transitions, evaluate phase purity and compositional and structural disorder, and probe molecular dynamics and ionic motion in diverse forms of LHPs, in which they can be used practically, ranging from bulk single crystals (e.g., in gamma and X-ray detectors) to polycrystalline films (e.g., in photovoltaics, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes) and colloidal nanocrystals (e.g., in liquid crystal displays and future quantum light sources). Herein we also outline the immense practical potential of nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy for characterizing LHPs, owing to the strong quadrupole moments, good sensitivity, and high natural abundance of several halide nuclei (79/81Br and 127I) combined with the enhanced electric field gradients around these nuclei existing in LHPs as well as the instrumental simplicity. Strong quadrupole interactions, on one side, make 79/81Br and 127I NMR rather impractical but turn NQR into a high-resolution probe of the local structure around halide ions.},

This review covers different aspects of the use of NQR spectroscopy for drug development and analysis and illustrates the power and versatility of this method in the determination of impurities, polymorphic forms, the drug's structure and conformation, characterization of the interactions between the drug and ligands, search for analogs (second- or third-generation drugs) and the drug's thermal stability.

Recent technological advances in pulsed NQR methods have shortened detection times, eliminated spurious signals, and enhanced the sensitivity of detection of 14N frequencies, which lie in the low rf range of 0.4−6 MHz, encouraging a wider range of “real world” applications. This Perspective highlights some of the advantages of NQR, the applications in which it could be used, such as the quantification of pharmaceuticals and the identification of polymorphs. Other roles could include detection, analysis, and quality control of pharmaceuticals at all stages of manufacture.

The fundamental chemical interactions which control the structure and performance of cements have been the subject of intense research for decades, but the complex, crystallographically disordered nature of the key phases which form in hardened cements has raised difficulty in obtaining detailed information about local structure, reaction mechanisms and kinetics. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS NMR) spectroscopy can resolve key atomic structural details within these materials and has emerged as a crucial tool in characterising cement structure and properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of multinuclear SS NMR spectroscopy to understand composition–structure–property relationships in cements.

A two-site exchange model for the T1 relaxation rate data yields sorption densities in excellent quantitative agreement with sorption isotherm measurements for portlandite and C4AC̄H11. For jennite, the NMR results underestimate the sorption isotherm results by about 40\%, but the sorption densities are low, and the results are probably in agreement within experimental error. The observed sorption densities are much greater than can be accommodated by bonding directly to atoms on the solid surfaces and the amount predicted to be in the Stern and diffuse layers by a Gouy-Chapman calculation assuming sorption of only isolated chloride ions. The significance of understanding the structural and dynamical properties of solution-state chloride and the roles of ion pairs and clusters in the solution near the solid surface are discussed.},

It is shown that the N.Q.R. thermometer exhibits unique properties of sensitivity, range, and reproducibility that are all desirable qualities for a temperature standard. The response to temperature is a unique characteristic of the working substance, which in this case is KClO3. Experimentally, the center frequency of the absorption line of Cl35 in pure samples of KClO3 at 77 °K is reproducible to approximately 2 Hz. This corresponds to an absolute accuracy of better than ± 0.001 °K. The purity of the samples is achieved by recrystallization of commercial reagents. The range of the thermometer extends from 10 °K to approximately 450 °K. A description of a simple system which locks an oscillator to the N.Q.R. absorption line is given. A new method of determining accurately the frequency of the center of the line using magnetic field broadening is also described. With this technique a sensitivity of ± 0.0002 °K is expected. In line with these results, evaluation of a thermometer based on the temperature dependence of the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency in antiferromagnetic salts is made.},

Special care was taken for the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to crystal orientation which was obtained by in-situ pulsed NMR-experiments. It has been shown that in the investigated parameter range nonlinear effects in NMR due to high spin alignment had no significant influence. In pulsed NMR as well as in specific heat experiments it could be shown that spin-spin interactions are only weak in Ga and do not influence nuclear paramagnetism, at least at temperatures above 100 μK.

	abstract = {We describe hardware, pulse sequences, and algorithms for nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy of medicines and dietary supplements. Medicine and food safety is a pressing problem that has drawn more and more attention. NQR is an ideal technique for authenticating these substances because it is a non-invasive method for chemical identification. We have recently developed a broadband NQR front-end that can excite and detect 14N NQR signals over a wide frequency range; its operating frequency can be rapidly set by software, while sensitivity is comparable to conventional narrowband front-ends over the entire range. This front-end improves the accuracy of authentication by enabling multiple-frequency experiments. We have also developed calibration and signal processing techniques to convert measured NQR signal amplitudes into nuclear spin densities, thus enabling its use as a quantitative technique. Experimental results from several samples are used to illustrate the proposed methods.},

It provides a method for measuring these shifts, and may be used even when the shift is several orders of magnitude smaller than the linewidth. The characteristics of the apparatus used in making these observations are briefly described, and some problems arising in the application of this effect to the measurement of electric field shifts are discussed.},

The lattice restoring forces for loose ions are investigated through the use of the Born-Mayer theory of ionic bonding. We find that the predicted ionic 𝑔 shift is considerably larger than that observed. This may be due to substantial local distortion near a Yb impurity.

Investigating the zero nuclear spin isotope (𝐼=0) transition of Er3+:CaWO4 as a model system, we provide a quantitative analysis of the time-dependent photon counting rate following an excitation pulse, as a function of its power. The achieved signal-to-noise ratio is found to be an order of magnitude higher than the one obtained by inductively detected Hahn echo under identical conditions. Finally, we use spin fluorescence spectroscopy at low excitation power to probe the properties of rare-earth ions close to a metallic wire deposited on the surface; our data reveal line distortion caused by the mechanical strain imparted by the thermal contractions of the metal relative to the underlying crystal. Coherent oscillations are also observed for the most highly strained ions.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \${\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}2\$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API.

Radial integrals and spin‐orbit coupling parameter derived from fitting the position of the centers of gravity of the J manifolds in intermediate coupling are F2=423.89 cm−1, F4=67.995 cm−1, F6=6.667 cm−1, ζ=2377 cm−1. A first‐order crystal field calculation based on the intermediate coupling states of the free ion is shown to account very satisfactorily for the optical spectrum, paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic hyperfine structure when using 〈 r−3〉 and the nuclear moment measured by atomic beam triple magnetic resonance. The agreement between the experimental and calculated crystalline quantum numbers is encouraging since they were not forced to fit in the calculation. Also, the fact that the 〈 r−3〉 values obtained for a truly free erbium atom can be used for the case of the ion in a crystalline host indicates that the 4f wavefunctions are little affected by the surroundings.

The above parameters predict the Stark splittings of the 53 states up to 25 000 cm−1 with an rms deviation of 4.4 cm−1. The calculated g factors are g∥c(Z1)=1.21, g ⊥c(Z1)=8.45, g∥c(Z2)=3.65, g ⊥c(Z2)=7.03; the corresponding measured values are 1.247, 8.38, 3.42, and 6.98, respectively. The calculated and measured values of the hyperfine structure constants are: Acalc167= 41.61×10−4 cm−1, Ameas167= (42.5±0.5)×10−4 cm−1, Bcalc167= 290.60×10−4 cm−1, Bmeas167= (293±3)×10−4 cm−1.},

	abstract = {Rare-earth-ion (REI) ensembles in crystals have remarkable optical and spin properties characterized by narrow homogeneous linewidths relative to the inhomogeneous ensemble broadening. This makes it possible to precisely tailor the ensemble spectral density and therefore the absorption profile by applying narrow-linewidth radiation to transfer population into auxiliary levels, a process broadly known as spectral hole burning (SHB). REI-doped crystals find applications in information processing, both classical (pattern recognition, filtering, spectral analysis) and quantum (photon storage), all protocols requiring suitable ensemble preparation by SHB as a first step. In Er\${\textasciicircum}\{3+\}\$-doped materials, the longest reported hole lifetime is one minute, and longer lifetimes are desirable. Here, we report SHB and accumulated echo measurements in a scheelite crystal of CaWO\$\_4\$ by pumping the electron spin transition of Er\${\textasciicircum}\{3+\}\$ ions at microwave frequencies and millikelvin temperatures, with nuclear spin states of neighboring \${\textasciicircum}\{183\}\$W atoms serving as the auxiliary levels. The lifetime of the holes and accumulated echoes rises steeply as the sample temperature is decreased, exceeding a month at 10 mK. Our results demonstrate that millikelvin temperatures can be beneficial for signal processing applications requiring long spectral hole lifetimes.},

The Hamiltonian thus derived obviously includes all possible independent spin-operators, and, in general, has more terms than those considered in the usual spin-Hamiltonian. The method has been applied to the case of cubic crystalline symmetry, and the spin-Hamiltonian is written out correctly for the Zeeman field (H) independent part and the linearly field-dependent part, for all ions with both electron spin S and nuclear spin I up to 2. Terms which are quadratic in H are considered for spin values S and I up to 1 only. Relative importance of the independent operators are discussed with particular reference to two cases: Co2+ in eight co-ordinated cubic compounds and Yb3+ in CaF2, which are expected to be two extreme examples of the effect of the excited levels on the ground state. Some of the terms which are usually neglected in the usual spin-Hamiltonian are shown to make significant contributions to the spin-levels. The importance of the terms quadratic in Zeeman field is emphasized for precise ENDOR experiments.},

Pertinent matrix elements for a single valence electron are calculated relativistically.

In this work we also take into account quantitatively the effect of some electronic configuration interaction. Finally the values of nuclear magnetic octupole moments expected according to different models are calculated and compared with the experimental data thus far collected.

Er3+ dopants introduced localized visible–light transition states within the band gap, thus adding pink hues to the white CaWO4 for both codoping systems. Phase-pure materials were obtained up to the doping levels of x = 0.10, beyond which impurity peaks in powder X-ray diffraction patterns emerged. Reduction in lattice constants and grain sizes due to dopant substitution was observed. No evidence was seen for long-range magnetic ordering above 0.5 K, and the local crystal field of Er3+ was different for the two codopants.

	abstract = {A new class of experiments is introduced to electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy that utilizes hyperfine decoupling for resolution enhancement and spectrum simplification, and that provides a basis for correlation techniques. A general framework is provided for the discussion of pulse ESR experiments on systems with arbitrary effective electron spin S and an arbitrary number of coupled nuclear spins and is used to describe spin decoupling in pulse ESR and ENDOR spectroscopy. Analytical expressions are given for the hyperfine-decoupled nuclear frequencies and the residual hyperfine splittings of spin-1/2 nuclei during strong decoupling. Pulse sequences are proposed for hyperfine-decoupled electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments as well as for the correlation of the hyperfine-decoupled ESEEM spectrum with two-pulse and three-pulse ESEEM spectra and of hyperfine-decoupled ENDOR with the hyperfine splittings. It is shown that hyperfine-decoupled ESEEM and ENDOR spectra can reveal information on the magnetic quantum numbers involved in an ESR observer transition, and that choosing a transition mS↔mS+1 with mS≠−1/2 can improve the resolution of a nuclear frequency spectrum. In addition, such experiments can be used to determine the relative signs of hyperfine couplings. The potential of the two-dimensional DECENT (decoupled ESEEM correlated to nuclear transition frequencies) experiment is demonstrated on weakly coupled N14 nuclei in both an ordered and a disordered system and on the hexaquo manganese (II) complex (S=5/2) in a single crystal. It is also shown that for the ESR observer transition mS=(−3/2↔−5/2) the S=5/2 system yields highly resolved hyperfine-decoupled ENDOR spectra which allow for a complete assignment of the ENDOR lines.},

In an electromagnetic field, the presence of virtual photons manifests itself as a small renormalization of the energy of a quantum system, known as the Lamb shift. We present an experimental observation of the Lamb shift in a solid-state system. The strong dispersive coupling of a superconducting electronic circuit acting as a quantum bit (qubit) to the vacuum field in a transmission-line resonator leads to measurable Lamb shifts of up to 1.4\% of the qubit transition frequency. The qubit is also observed to couple more strongly to the vacuum field than to a single photon inside the cavity, an effect that is explained by taking into account the limited anharmonicity of the higher excited qubit states.},

	abstract = {We have performed spectroscopy of a superconducting charge qubit coupled nonresonantly to a single mode of an on-chip resonator. The strong coupling induces a large ac Stark shift in the energy levels of both the qubit and the resonator. The dispersive shift of the resonator frequency is used to nondestructively determine the qubit state. Photon shot noise in the measurement field induces qubit level fluctuations leading to dephasing which is characteristic for the measurement backaction. A crossover in line shape with measurement power is observed and theoretically explained. For weak measurement a long intrinsic dephasing time of 𝑇2 {\textgreater}200 n⁢s of the qubit is found.},

This was done by measuring the Stark effect on the nuclear quadrupole transitions of 151Eu in Y2⁢SiO5 (YSO) using a combination of Raman heterodyne optical detection and Stark modulated quadrupole echoes to achieve high sensitivity. The measured Stark coefficients were 0.42 and 1.0 Hz cm/V for the two quadrupole transitions at 34.54 and 46.20 MHz, respectively. The long decoherence time of the nuclear spin states (25 ms) allowed us to make the measurements in very low electric fields of ∼10 V/cm, which produced 100\% modulation of the nuclear spin echo, and to measure Stark shifts of ∼1 Hz or 20 ppm of the inhomogeneous linewidth.},

	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-01496176},
	abstract = {In usual electron-spin resonance (ESR) experiments, the coupling between spins and their electromagnetic environment is quite weak, severely limiting the sensitivity of the measurements. Using a Josephson parametric microwave amplifier combined with high-quality factor superconducting micro-resonators cooled at millikelvin temperatures, this work reports the design and implementation of an ESR setup where the detection sensitivity is limited by quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field instead of thermal or technical noise. Pulsed ESR measurements on an ensemble of Bismuth donors in Silicon spins demonstrate a sensitivity of 1700 spins within a single Hahn echo with unit signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. The sensitivity of the setup is improved one step further by generating squeezed vacuum in the detection waveguide, reducing the amount of noise beyond the quantum limit. The high-quality factors and small mode volume superconducting microwave ESR resonator developed for enhanced sensitivity also enhances the spin-resonator coupling up to the point where quantum fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics. As a consequence, the spin spontaneous emission of microwave photons in the resonator is dramatically enhanced by the Purcell effect, making it the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is increased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to resonance, showing that spin relaxation can be engineered and controlled on-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialize spin systems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and quantum information processing.},

	title = {Electron spin dynamics of erbium ions in scheelite crystals, probed with superconducting resonators at millikelvin temperatures},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-03579857},
	abstract = {One of the many challenges of quantum technologies is to interface long-lived stationary quantum information with propagating photons in communication networks. Erbium doped crystals are particularly suited for this task. Indeed, erbium ions have an optical transition at 1.5 µm which falls in the spectral window where optical fibers have minimal losses. Moreover, erbium ions have a spin degree of freedom because their ground state is a doublet which behaves as an effective electron spin half. The large magnetic moment of this electron spin is an advantage to couple efficiently to other quantum systems, such as neighboring nuclear spins or superconducting processors. Up to now, the coherence time of the erbium electron spin, on a magnetically-sensitive transition, was however limited to 50 µs, which is insufficient for these quantum network applications. In this thesis, we improve this coherence time by nearly three orders of magnitude. We first choose scheelite (CaWO4) as a host crystal for its low magnetic moment density and we work with a nominally undoped crystal, such that the residual concentration of impurities like erbium is of the order of part per billion. We then cool the sample down to 10 mK, in order to quench the decoherence process arising from the magnetic coupling of the erbium ions to other impurities. At this temperature, coherence times up to 30 ms are reported and are shown to be limited by the interaction of erbium with the nuclear spins of the host crystal. We also study a scheelite crystal with a 10⁴ times larger erbium concentration, which is more suited for quantum memory applications, and measure coherence times up to 1 ms. Both experiments confirm that erbium ions in scheelite are interesting for realizing quantum network nodes and hybrid quantum systems, due to their large magnetic field sensitivity and their long coherence times.},

	title = {Electron spin resonance spectroscopy based on fluorescence detection at millikelvin temperature, applied to rare earth ions in scheelite},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-04064249},
	abstract = {Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a characterization method applicable to a wide variety of spin systems. This method, usually based on the Inductive Detection (ID) of spin echo, has a low sensitivity, restricting the detection to large spin ensembles. Improving the sensitivity while keeping the generality of application is desirable to characterize small spin ensemble properties.This thesis explores a new ESR detection method - the Fluorescence Detection (FD) - recently developed in Quantronics group. We apply it to the spectroscopy of rare earth ions in Scheelite using a Single Microwave Photon Detector device, at millikelvin temperature. The experiment uses a superconducting resonator magnetically coupled to the resonant spin ensemble, in order to manipulate and detect the spin signal. We report large-scale FD-ESR spectra showing signal from a wide variety of spin species, proving the generality of this detection method. As FD gives immediately access to the spin fluorescence, it calls for a better understanding of spin relaxation curve. Focusing on Erbium ions, we model the spin ensemble dynamics as the sum of single spin contribution and perform simulations that quantitatively reproduce the fluorescence signal over three orders of magnitude in excitation pulse strength. The comparison of ID and FD in similar spin excitation conditions confirms a sensitivity gain with FD for spin detection, reaching a factor 15 at the lowest excitation strength explored. This higher sensitivity allows us to measure the frequency shifts caused by mechanical strain on a small spin sub-ensemble, and to study its dependence with the static field angle. Thanks to the spin sub-ensemble coupling homogeneity, we observe spin coherent oscillations. Although FD is sensitive to incoherent photons, we use a three-pulse sequence to perform FD of Hahn echoes. We characterize the spin coherence time using FD, and demonstrate a method to get around the limitation in spin coherence time due to magnetic field noise. Eventually, we show that there is also a sensitivity gain with FD compared to ID for echo detection.},

	title = {Addressing individual electronic spins with a microwave superconducting resonator},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-04162672},
	abstract = {Single spins in solids are good candidates for implementing quantum bits for quantum information processing thanks to their long coherence times. However, being individual atomic-scale quantum objects, they are difficult to address and to entangle with one another. This thesis work explores two distinct but related approaches for manipulating and detecting single spins, both involving comparable hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms operated at millikelvin temperatures. In the first approach, single electron spin resonance (ESR) is demonstrated by spin fluorescence detection: a microwave photon counter is used to detect the photon emitted by an excited spin. The spins are paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal, and are coupled magnetically to a high-quality factor planar superconducting resonator. They are detected individually with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in a one second-integration time. The fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the engineered spin radiative lifetime. This single-spin quantum control experiment also opens the route to new applications of ESR, in particular for microscopic object characterization. In the second approach, the detection of spins is based on leveraging the charge degree of freedom of hole spins and their strong intrinsic spin-orbit interaction. We demonstrate a compact novel platform made of electrostatically defined quantum dots in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure, filled with hole spins by optical illumination. The spins are coupled electrically to a superconducting resonator for probing their charge and spin states. Using this resonator as a dispersive readout, we show that single charge tunneling events in the dots can be detected after illumination. This represents a critical step towards addressing single hole spin in a semiconductor. Overall, the two methods reported in this thesis open new avenues for the development of quantum sensing and quantum computing applications.},
